# Task 4 Documentation

## Context

Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) is a methodology to predict the crystal structure of a molecule. The workflow for this task consists of five key exercises, focusing on the prediction and analysis of molecular crystal structures. 

Reference: Schrodinger webinar on CSP.

For this task, we will prioritize the first three exercises:

1. **3D Conformation Search**
   - Reference: Streamlit UI
   - Goal: Display 3D conformers of molecules based on input SMILES strings.

2. **Sampling the Crystal Structure Landscape**
   - Goal: Plot histograms to visualize sampled crystal density and related properties.

3. **Preliminary Screening**
   - Goal: Analyze and compare Density vs. Lattice Energy (LE) to identify potential crystal candidates.

## Objective

The primary objective is to build a user-friendly application that supports the entire CSP workflow, with a focus on predicting the crystal structure of molecules. The application will cater to all five workflow steps, starting with 3D conformation search and progressing to advanced and final screenings.

## Requirements

1. A tab-based UI to navigate through the different exercises:
   - **Tab 1**: Display 3D conformers of molecules.
   - **Tab 2**: Plot histograms for crystal structure sampling.
   - **Tab 3**: Visualize and analyze Density vs. Lattice Energy (LE).

2. Inputs and outputs for each tab:
   - **Tab 1**: Input SMILES, output 3D conformers.
   - **Tab 2**: Input crystal structure parameters, output density histogram.
   - **Tab 3**: Input CIF and Lattice Energy, output scatter plots and rankings.

## Approach

1. **UI Development**:
   - Use a framework like Streamlit for rapid prototyping and interactive UI.
   - Implement tabs for each workflow step.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - Parse SMILES strings to generate 3D conformers (Tab 1).
   - Process crystal structure data to sample and visualize densities (Tab 2).
   - Analyze lattice energy and density for preliminary screening (Tab 3).

3. **Integration**:
   - Ensure seamless data flow between tabs.
   - Add interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Validate outputs for each tab with benchmark datasets.
   - Refine visualizations based on user feedback.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Generating accurate 3D conformers from SMILES.
  - **Solution**: Utilize established cheminformatics libraries (e.g., RDKit).

- **Challenge**: Handling large datasets for crystal landscape sampling.
  - **Solution**: Implement efficient data processing pipelines.

- **Challenge**: Visualizing complex relationships in Density vs. Lattice Energy.
  - **Solution**: Leverage interactive plots with filtering capabilities.

## Outcome

The application will provide an intuitive and interactive platform for CSP workflows, enabling researchers to predict and analyze crystal structures effectively.

## Future Improvements

- Extend support to the advanced and final screening steps (Exercises 4 and 5).
- Add export options for results and visualizations.
- Enhance scalability for handling larger datasets.
