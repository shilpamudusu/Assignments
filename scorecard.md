## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Scorecard Table
1. Fetch biomolecule data via a provided API and present it in a table format.
2. Display properties such as stability, affinity, and solubility, with each property visually categorized into ranges using color codes:
   - Green: Optimal
   - Yellow: Borderline
   - Red: Needs Attention
3. Support sorting and filtering based on property ranges and values.
4. Update the table dynamically as new data becomes available.

### 4.2. 3D Molecular Visualization
1. Integrate the Mol* JavaScript library for real-time 3D visualization.
2. Enable users to load and inspect the biomolecule structure by clicking a “View Structure” button for each table row.
3. Retrieve biomolecular structure data in PDB format via API.
4. Provide property-based visualization options, such as highlighting residues based on stability or hydrophobicity values from a JSON input.

### 4.3. Interactive Features
1. Allow users to color-code the structure based on residue properties.
2. Provide an intuitive UI (e.g., dropdowns) for selecting visualization criteria.
3. Support saving annotations and color schemes for future reference.

### 4.4. API Integration
1. Connect to multiple APIs:
   - API for scorecard data retrieval.
   - API for fetching 3D molecular structures (PDB format).
   - API for residue-specific property values.
2. Handle API responses efficiently to ensure smooth performance.
